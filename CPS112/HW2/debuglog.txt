1.
Errors like:
Square.java:58: error: cannot find symbol
    public boolean addFrog(Frog f)
                           ^
  symbol:   class Frog
  location: class Square

Solution:
Order the makefile correctly with Creature.class first so it can be compiled firstly.

2.
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: String index out of range: 0
	at java.lang.String.charAt(String.java:658)
	at World.<init>(World.java:125)
	at World.main(World.java:223)

Solution:
Read the first line file as a string then convert it to integer instead of simply reading the integer. 

3.
Can't show the squares when running the code.
Exception in thread "AWT-EventQueue-0" java.lang.NullPointerException

Solution:
(Prof.Weaver) Didn't initialize the fly in the World.java's nested loop.

4.
error: non-static method gameOver(boolean) cannot be referenced from a static context

Solution:
Uses “gameOver(boolean)” instead of “World.gameOver(boolean)” (Helped by tutor).

5.
Having trouble with the array frogs: tried to add the Frog objects but returned “null”. I think it is the reason why I can’t move the frogs in the update method (even though one of the frogs does move and eats).

Solution:
1)Tried to set “this.frogs = frogs” hoping it can be read in update method. Didn’t work (Maybe due to the null items in the array)
2)take the counter of frogs out of the nested loop, works.

6.
The resetPosition method didn’t work.

Solution:
Reorder the codes and checking the safety of the fly again if the location is reset. 

7.
Sometimes the fly can be eaten but sometimes it can’t.

Solution:
Reorder the codes to put the check(eatsFly) in the correct place.
