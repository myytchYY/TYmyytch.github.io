1.
Having trouble understand how to use the variable modCOunt because of its definition.

Solution:(Prof. Weaver) Just use it the same as using the variable "numbOfItem" in the lab.


2.
 error: name clash: indexOf(T) in ArrayBackedList and indexOf(Object) in AbstractList have the same erasure, yet neither overrides the other
	public int indexOf (T item)
	           ^
  where T is a type-variable:
    T extends Object declared in class ArrayBackedList
ArrayBackedList.java:112: error: method does not override or implement a method from a supertype

Solution: Changed T to Object.

3.
error: cannot find symbol
    { return SimpleArrayIterator (this);     }
              ^
  symbol:   method SimpleArrayIterator(SimpleArrayList)
  location: class SimpleArrayList

Solution: add “new” after return.

4.
SimpleArrayList.java:80: error: no suitable method found for add(Object)
	    copyList.add(iter.previous());
	            ^
    method SimpleArrayList.add(int,int) is not applicable
      (actual and formal argument lists differ in length)
    method SimpleArrayList.add(int) is not applicable
      (actual argument Object cannot be converted to int by method invocation conversion)
    method SimpleAbstractList.add(int,int) is not applicable
      (actual and formal argument lists differ in length)
    method SimpleAbstractList.add(int) is not applicable
      (actual argument Object cannot be converted to int by method invocation conversion)
1 error

Solution: Convert Integer to int; didn’t work (error: iter.previous returns Object not Integer);
	use (int) before iter.previous instead, works.
